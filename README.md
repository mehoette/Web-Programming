# Web-Programming

Here are multiple projects from my web programming class. 
You should be able to see them up and running at https://thor.quincy.edu/~m.hoette80/
Please note: That link is a University server, so it may be purged at any time because I am not an active student.

- index.html - basic landing page. I just needed a page to put all my projects.
- P1 - basic understanding of HTML and CSS, cow information page
- P2 - using JavaScript to add functionality to web pages, Saying Hello, Calculator and mouse chase game
- P3 - using PHP to create dynamic websites that has a login and log out, see the date, rock paper scissors and repeated sentences
        note: username and password are hardcoded and "David" and "123456" respectively. On a real website, you would use a database to store usernames/passwords
- P4 - Bring it all together using AJAX, JSON and SQL, to do list
