This javascript is what displays all the tasks.
It also has 2 functions to call complete.php or
delete.php when the respective buttons are pressed.

It also uses ajax to update every 5 seconds or once
any button is pressed

//note: the console.log functions in the leave and complete functions aren't necessary, but they helped me when i was having trouble with those functions
